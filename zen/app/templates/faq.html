	<h1>FAQ</h1>
<div class="alert alert-info"><strong>How does vote-reward work ?</strong></div>
<p>
Voting for a delegate helps to push it within the top {{ info.delegate }} to be
allowed to forge blocks. Then, its associated node can puts transactions
in a block, signs it and inserts it into the blockchain. For each forged block,
the delegate wallet receives {{ "%d"%info.blockreward }}&nbsp;{{ info.symbol | safe }}
plus the fees of forged transaction(s).
</p>
<p>
The one runing this delegate may decide to share his reward to his voters. The
most common way is to distribute rewards according to individual vote weight.
</p>
<p>
Here, the share is computed and distributed according to vote weight each
time a block is forged. It is the True Block Weight mechanism.
</p>

<div class="alert alert-info"><strong>How much may I get ?</strong></div>
<p>
Within {{ info.network }} network, block delay is {{ info.blocktime }}&nbsp;seconds.
A delegate forges a block every {{ info.blocktime * info.delegate }} seconds
that makes {{  _currency(tph) }} per hour. So on a daily basis, the maximum a
delegate could distribute is {{  _currency(tph*24) }}.
Important thing to notify here is that your vote weight might fluctuate between
two forged block according to total vote variation.
</p>
<ul class="alert-warning">
{%- for username in delegates %}
<li>If you voted for {{ username }} and your vote weight is 1%, you will get
{{ _currency(tph*24 *delegates[username].share*0.01) }} per day.</li>
{%- endfor %}
</ul>

<div class="alert alert-info"><strong>Can I withdraw part of my voting wallet ?</strong></div>
<p>
Yes. Because sometime it is interesting to trade {{ info.symbol | safe }}, it is
allowed to withdraw part of the wallet but your relative vote weight will decrease.
<ul class="alert-warning">
{%- for username in delegates %}
<li>If you voted for {{ username }}
{%- if delegates[username].minimum_vote %}
you will have to keep a minimum of {{ _currency(delegates[username].minimum_vote) }}.</li>
{%- else %}
you will have to keep a minimum of {{ _currency(1) }}.</li>
{%- endif %}
{%- endfor %}
</ul>
</p>

<div class="alert alert-info"><strong>Do I need to register somewhere ?</strong></div>
<p>
No. You only have to vote for the delegate using

<ul class="alert-warning">
{%- for username in delegates %}
{%- if delegates[username].minimum_vote %}
<li>
If you voted for {{ username }} you will need a minimum of
{{ _currency(delegates[username].minimum_vote) }}.
</li>
{%- endif %}
{%- endfor %}
</ul>
</p>

<div class="alert alert-info"><strong>Will I get my pending reward if I unvote delegate ?</strong></div>
<p>
No. Once the delegate is unvoted, the undistributed share is redistributed to
the other voters.
